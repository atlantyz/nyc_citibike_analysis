Summary
The visualizations of the data presented here demonstrate the potential for the bike sharing program in Iowa. The gender analyses illustrate the diversity of the potential consumer. The weekday per hour analysis illustrates that bikes are primarily used before and after working hours, and placing the bikes in large corporate areas in Iowa is likely to be successful.
